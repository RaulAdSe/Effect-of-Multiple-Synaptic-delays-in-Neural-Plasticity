# Effect-of-Multiple-Synaptic-delays-in-Neural-Plasticity

A computational neurocience project. The aim of the project was to formulate a model accounting with the spatial distribution of neurons via propagation delays.
A spiking neural network is built, then STDP synaptic plasticity rule is implemented and then modified.
Finally, an study of how the spatial distribution and the external stimuli affects final state of the network after the learning process.

Unfortunately, this project is protected by a confidentiality agreement due to the future publication of itself. Only some insights will be shown.
